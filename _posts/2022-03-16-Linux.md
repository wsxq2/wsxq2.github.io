## 内存管理

### 内存释放

#### drop_caches

> drop_caches
>
> Writing to this will cause the kernel to drop clean caches, as well as
>
> reclaimable slab objects like dentries and inodes. Once dropped, their
>
> memory becomes free.
>
> To free pagecache:
>
> echo 1 \> /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
>
> To free reclaimable slab objects (includes dentries and inodes):
>
> echo 2 \> /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
>
> To free slab objects and pagecache:
>
> echo 3 \> /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
>
> This is a non-destructive operation and will not free any dirty objects.
>
> To increase the number of objects freed by this operation, the user may run
>
> \`sync' prior to writing to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches. This will minimize the
>
> number of dirty objects on the system and create more candidates to be
>
> dropped.
>
> This file is not a means to control the growth of the various kernel caches
>
> (inodes, dentries, pagecache, etc...) These objects are automatically
>
> reclaimed by the kernel when memory is needed elsewhere on the system.
>
> Use of this file can cause performance problems. Since it discards cached
>
> objects, it may cost a significant amount of I/O and CPU to recreate the
>
> dropped objects, especially if they were under heavy use. Because of this,
>
> use outside of a testing or debugging environment is not recommended.
>
> You may see informational messages in your kernel log when this file is
>
> used:
>
> cat (1234): drop_caches: 3
>
> These are informational only. They do not mean that anything is wrong
>
> with your system. To disable them, echo 4 (bit 3) into drop_caches.
